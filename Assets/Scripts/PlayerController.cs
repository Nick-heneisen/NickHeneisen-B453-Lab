        #region JumpingVeclocity Explanation
        /**
        The movement calculation should only modify horizontal movement.
        Vertical movement should be handled separately using as seperate Vector3 velocity.y.

        When you modify movement.y for jumping, you run into the issue of overwrite it when handling gravity.
        You need a persistent variable(e.g., velocity.y) to track vertical movement over multiple frames.
        Gravity is applied incorrectly

        Right now, gravity and movement are stored in movement.y, but movement is recalculated every frame.
        When jumping, movement.y = jumpForce; only lasts for one frame and is reset immediately.
        Incorrect movement application order
